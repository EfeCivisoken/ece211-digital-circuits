# ECE 211 - Digital Circuits I Labs

This repository contains selected lab projects and exercises completed during my ECE 211 - Digital Circuits I course.

The labs cover a variety of core digital circuit design concepts, including combinational and sequential logic, finite state machines, traffic light controllers, and practical hardware implementations using SystemVerilog and related tools.

## Labs Included

- **lab3** — Advanced comparators using 7400-Series integrated circuits
- **LAB04** — Code Conversion – POSTNET to Binary
- **lab5 demo** — Binary adders/subtractors
- **lab06-worksheet-format** — Practical exercises on simulation and testbench development
- **Lab 7** — Design and implementation of a Hamming Code-based error correction system
- **lab08 demo files** — Sequential counter design
- **lab09 demo files** — Sequential LED tail light for automotive applications (Mustang-style)
- **LAB10-full-traffic-light-design** — Full Traffic Light Controller Design using Moore FSMs

## Contribution Note

While some labs were completed as part of assigned teams or pairs, I took initiative to personally complete nearly all of the design, coding, simulation, and debugging work across these projects.

I approached this course with a strong commitment to mastering the material and developing practical digital design skills. In many cases, I carried the majority of the technical workload — ensuring that the resulting designs, implementations, and outcomes met both functional and academic standards.

This repository therefore reflects both the required lab outcomes and my individual effort in driving the technical execution of these projects.

For more exact information, please refer to the detailed lab reports in each subfolder.
