# ECE 211 - Digital Circuits I Labs

This repository contains selected lab projects and exercises completed during my ECE 211 - Digital Circuits I course.

The labs cover a variety of core digital circuit design concepts, including combinational and sequential logic, finite state machines, traffic light controllers, and practical hardware implementations using SystemVerilog and related tools.

## Labs Included

- **Lab 3** — Advanced comparators using 7400-Series integrated circuits
- **Lab 4** — Code Conversion – POSTNET to Binary
- **Lab 5** — Binary adders/subtractors
- **Lab 6 (Worksheet)** — Worksheet and practical exercises on simulation/testbenching
- **Lab 7** — Design and implementation of a Hamming Code-based error correction system
- **Lab 8** — Sequential counter
- **Lab 9** — Sequential LED tail light in Mustang cars
- **Lab 10** — Full Traffic Light Controller Design through Moore FSMs.

## Contribution Note

While some labs were completed as part of assigned teams or pairs, I took initiative to personally complete nearly all of the design, coding, simulation, and debugging work across these projects.

I approached this course with a strong commitment to mastering the material and developing practical digital design skills. This meant that in many cases, I carried the majority of the technical workload — ensuring that the resulting designs, implementations, and results met both functional and academic standards.

This repository therefore reflects both the required lab outcomes and my individual effort in driving the technical execution of these projects.

## Technologies and Tools

- SystemVerilog
- Vivado / related FPGA design tools
- Digital circuit simulation and synthesis
- Finite State Machine (FSM) design
- Sequential and combinational circuit analysis
